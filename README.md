> Started in Figma, ended up on the App Store. Still not sure how that happened, but I'm not stopping.

### Philosophy

> "Design is how it works" – I build tools to solve my own problems, then share them with the design community. Currently exploring how AI changes everything about how designers ship.

### Random Facts

- Two apps on the App Store and counting
- Figma Config '22 speaker
- Started designing in 2013, went product in 2021
- Powered by Accra jollof and too many Figma files
- Believes every designer should learn to code (at least a little)
